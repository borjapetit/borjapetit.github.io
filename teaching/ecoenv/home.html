          <ul>
            <li>
              There will be 4 midterm exams during the course, but only the best 3 midterm exams will count for the final grade.

            <li>
              Each midterm exam will cover the material taught since the previous midterm exam.

            <li>
              The midterm exams will consist of multiple-choice questions and short-answer questions.

            <li>
              If the student fails the final exam, the final mark to be included in the studentâ€™s record will be the final exam mark out of 10.

              If the student does not take the final exam or is unable to take the final exam because the required percentage of attendance has not been achieved, the final exam mark will be zero. This criterion applies to both regular and extraordinary examinations.
