      We study monetary transmission in a model of state-dependent prices and wages based on "control costs". Stickiness arises because precise choice is costly: decision-makers tolerate errors both in the timing of adjustments, and in the new level at which the price or wage is set. The model is calibrated to microdata on the size and frequency of price and wage changes. In our simulations, money shocks have less persistent real effects than in the Calvo framework; nonetheless, the model exhibits a substantial degree of non-neutrality, driven mainly by wage rigidity. State-dependent nominal stickiness implies a flatter Phillips curve as trend inflation declines, because price and wage adjustments become less frequent, making short-run inflation less reactive to shocks. Our model can explain almost half of the observed decline in the slope of the Phillips curve since 2000.

        This paper quantifies the aggregate effects of firing costs in a model of firm dynamics where firm-level productivity is determined by innovation. In the model, the productivity distribution is endogenous, and thus, potentially affected by policy changes, allowing the model to capture both the static (allocative efficiency) and dynamic effects (changes in the distribution of firms' productivity) of firing costs. The model is calibrated to match key features of firms' hiring and firing behavior using firm-level data from Spanish non-financial firms. I show that firing costs equivalent to 2.5 monthly wages produce a 4% loss in aggregate productivity relative to the frictionless economy. The aggregate productivity losses rise to more than 10% when firing costs are equivalent to one year's wage. I show that a model with a standard AR(1) productivity process can only generate between 45 and 50% of these productivity losses. Overall, the results suggest that ignoring the effects of frictions on the dynamics of firms' productivity can substantially underestimate their aggregate effects.

        <!--The presence of children in US households reduces tax liabilities through deductions and tax credits. Through the lens of the quantity-quality trade-off, these benefits distort parental choices over the number and human capital of children by altering their relative implicit price. This paper quantifies the effects of child-related tax benefits on fertility and intergenerational mobility using a general equilibrium life-cycle model with endogenous fertility choices and parental investments in children's human capital, calibrated to US data. I show that tax benefits increase fertility by 16%, but they do so at the expense of lowering human capital of children. More importantly, these effects are particularly strong among low educated mothers, which widens the gap in human capital between children of low and high educated mothers. As a result, the intergenerational persistence of education increases by 37% when tax benefits are introduced. I also show that education subsidies are also effective at fostering fertility but, as opposed to tax benefits, they do not decrease children's human capital, nor intergenerational mobility.-->
        Participation in social insurance (welfare) programs exhibits a significant persistence across generations. Children of welfare program participants are more likely to participate in these programs when they become adults, even after controlling for their income. This suggests some persistence in some underlying factors that affect the participation decisions of eligible households. While some eligible households in need might choose not to participate, other eligible households in better conditions benefit from welfare programs, limiting the effectiveness of these programs. To understand the source of this persistence and its implications on households and their children, we build a quantitative model overlapping generations with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets. In the model, poor households may decide not to receive welfare transfers due to a utility cost from program participation. This cost depends on whether parents of a household had participated in welfare programs. Households also invest money and time in children's skills, which determine their labor-market ability as adults. The model is calibrated to the US data on welfare participation, income inequality, and intergenerational mobility from the 2000s. Using our calibrated model, we study how much of the persistence in welfare participation is due to the cost of participation and how this persistence affects parental investment in children. We find that around 20% of the intergenerational correlation in welfare participation can be explained by the transmission of the welfare culture across generations.

        Welfare program participation exhibits a significant persistence across generations. Children of welfare program participants are more likely to participate in these programs when they become adults, even after controlling for income. This suggests that the underlaying factors that make eligible households not to participate in welfare programs are correlated across generations ("welfare culture"). If these factors are not <i>iid</i> across households, some poor households may be displaced from welfare programs while some higher income âbut still poorâ households may get access to them, limiting their welfare gains. In order to better understand the source of this persistence and its welfare implications, we build a quantitative model with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets, where poor households may decide not to receive welfare transfers due to a stigma cost from program participation. The model combines intergenerational persistence in income, marital status and stigma cost, and is calibrated to the US in the 2000âs. Using our calibrated model, we find that the persistence in stigma cost accounts for as much as half of the persistence in welfare program participation, and substantially lowers the welfare gains from welfare programs. We find that abstracting from persistence in stigma cost overestimates the welfare gains from transfers by 20%.

        Productivity dynamics differ from a standard AR(1) process. They are non-linear (productivity persistence and shock variability depend on past productivity) and productivity shocks are non-Gaussian (the asymmetry and probability of having large shocks depend on the previous productivity levels). This paper asks if firm investment decisions can rationalize the productivity process seen in the data and, how productivity dynamics are endogenously affected by distortions and policies, such as financial frictions or firing costs. To answer those questions, we extend the standard firm dynamics model introducing endogenous productivity dynamics based on a âcontrol costâ approach from game theory. In particular, firms in the model can choose the distribution of productivity shocks at a cost, which is proportional to the deviation from a benchmark distribution. We calibrate the model to the Spanish economy and show that our extension is able to reconcile the main facts regarding the dynamics of firms' productivity while keeping the model tractable. To illustrate the relevance of accounting for non-linear productivity dynamics endogenously, we quantify the effects of different frictions and policies using our calibrated model. We show that the results are quantitatively different from a framework with a standard AR(1) process and one with non-linear exogenous dynamics.
